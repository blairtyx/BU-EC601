1) Health care is a right — not a privilege.

2) In the middle of a global pandemic, President Trump is trying to get the U.S. Supreme Court to eliminate Obamacare and rip health care protections away from 100 million Americans with pre-existing conditions.

Don't forget that.

3) Thank you, @CindyMcCain. Your support and your friendship mean the world to me. John and I didn't always agree on the issues, but we put aside our differences to find common ground and move the country forward — it's what I'll do every day as president. https://t.co/KheAlsKt73

4) I've spent my career working to end violence against women and will fight to end the epidemic of missing and murdered indigenous women. I applaud Congress for passing Savanna's Act this week.

Now, the Senate and President Trump need to reauthorize VAWA. It's long overdue. https://t.co/Xru7YzAUBD

5) Once again, we are called to ask ourselves whether justice could be equally applied in America. But what's clear is that today in America, Black women deserve better.

6) The Trump Administration says "the entire ACA must fall."

They are arguing to strip millions of Americans of health care in the middle of a pandemic.

We can't let him win. https://t.co/bcwiGz1HOn

7) In-person early voting should be easy and convenient for all. The Flint, MI City Clerk's office will be open the last three weekends before Election Day for folks to cast their ballots. It's an example that cities and states across the country should follow.

8) Michigan — You don’t have to wait until November 3rd to cast your ballot, early voting begins today across the state.

It's easy and it's important: head to https://t.co/iKOSl3K6fS to make your plan to vote early. https://t.co/KUDDuF8NZW

9) En el Día de la Virgen de las Mercedes, acompaño en solidaridad a todos los defensores de derechos humanos de Cuba, Nicaragua y Venezuela, y rezo por la liberación de todos los presos políticos.

10) On this Feast Day of Our Lady of Mercy, I stand in solidarity with all defenders of human rights from Cuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela — and pray for the freedom of all political prisoners.
