tyx 2020


## File Structures

### Phase 1: Twitter & Google API

`twitter_api` contains basic python test files and test results of ***Twitter API***

`google_nlp_api` contains basic python test files and test results of ***Google Cloud NLP API.*** 



### Phase 2: Build Social media Analyzer
`application` : contains the framework of my social media analyzer.



## Note:

### Error conditions

Q: What happens if twitter is not responding

Q: What happens if I pass the wrong handle

Q: What happens if Google NLP API does not respond back

## Data back and forth

Q: What do I send?

Q: What do I get?

Q:What is the format of the data?

How can I use such data?


Define MVP and user stories
Translate user stories to a modular design
Who is your user?
What are the basic user stories?



## Next Step

1. upgrade function in both twitter_api and google_nlp_api

2. integrate the functions together. 

   from `twitter_api` retreive targeted tweets -> format the tweet text -> send to `google_nlp_api` for sentiment analysis -> return the result.
